# Overview

In this take-home exercise, we will:

-   critic the submission of one of the Take-home Exercise 1 prepared by our classmate, in terms of clarity and aesthetics

-   prepare a sketch for the alternative design by using the data visualisation design principles and best practices you had learned in Lesson 1 and 2, and

-   remake the original design by using ggplot2, ggplot2 extensions and tidyverse packages.
